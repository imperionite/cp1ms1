## üìå Requirement Analysis

### Overview

MotorPH is developing an end-to-end payroll system to manage employee details, work hours, and salary calculations. The project will be built in phases, expanding capabilities over time. This document outlines the requirements for **Phase 1**, which focuses on basic employee management and payroll calculations.

### Objectives

- Design and visualize the application structure.
- Develop a Spring Boot-based backend to manage employee details.
- Implement functionality to calculate work hours, gross salary, and net salary.
- Ensure data accuracy and basic security measures.

#### Functional Requirements

##### Employee Information Management

- Store and retrieve employee details in the following format:

  - Employee Number
  - Employee Name
  - Birthday

- Develop an API endpoint to fetch employee details.

##### Work Hours Calculation

- Record and process employee log-in and log-out times.
- Calculate the total number of hours worked in a week.
- Handle multiple log-in/log-out records per day.

##### Gross Salary Calculation

- Compute gross weekly salary based on the total hours worked.
- Support different hourly rates for employees.
- Define a standard overtime calculation method (if applicable).

##### Net Salary Calculation

- Apply generic deductions, specifically:
  - **Fixed Tax Rate (e.g., 10%)**
  - **Standard Benefit Contribution (e.g., PhilHealth)**
- Compute net salary after deductions.
- Ensure accurate calculations based on predefined rules.

#### Non-Functional Considerations

While not explicitly mandated in the initial Phase 1 requirements, certain non-functional aspects have been considered to ensure a solid foundation for future development and a reasonable user experience. These considerations are implemented at a basic level, focusing on efficiency and security best practices.

##### Performance

- The system is designed to handle a moderate number of employee records efficiently. API responses are optimized for reasonably quick retrieval of employee data and salary calculations. These optimizations lay the groundwork for handling larger datasets in future phases.

##### Security

- Employee data is protected through basic measures to prevent unauthorized access. API endpoints include JWT-based authentication to secure access. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for admin/system user is implemented to showcase the application's security, though Manager/Approver level access control is outside the scope of Phase 1.

##### Scalability

- The system architecture is designed with future scalability in mind, allowing for the accommodation of more complex payroll rules and additional employee data fields in subsequent phases. This includes using a relational database and a modular code structure.

#### Deliverables

- **Week 4**: System visualization (UI wireframes, use case diagram).
- **Week 5**: Working code for employee information display.
- **Week 6**: Implementation of work hours calculation.
- **Week 7**: Gross salary computation logic.

##### Estimated Time per Task

Refer to this [link](https://tinyurl.com/mr4bjzjm) for the project's timeline and effort estimate in hours.

##### Estimated Project Completion

To determine the number of weeks required to complete my outputs for Phase 1 of the MotorPH Payroll System, I need to consider the estimated total hours of work and the expected weekly time commitment of 7.5 hours per week. Based on the complexity of the project, the development process involves multiple stages, including visualization, employee information display, work hours calculation, payroll computation, and system testing. If I estimate that the entire project will take approximately `75 hours to complete`, dividing this by the `7.5-hour weekly` commitment results in approximately `10 weeks to complete` the work. This timeline aligns with the expected 11-week completion timeframe.

## üìå Scope Delimitations and Known Limitations

To ensure a clear understanding of the boundaries of this Phase 1 implementation, this section outlines the specific functionalities that are explicitly excluded from the scope of this phase (Scope Delimitations), as well as acknowledges the known areas for future improvement in the current implementation (Known Limitations). This is intended to manage expectations and provide context for future development efforts.

**Limitations**

- **Single Developer:** As the sole developer on this project, all tasks including system design, coding, testing, and debugging are handled by one person. This may lead to limited bandwidth for tackling issues that arise during development, potentially impacting the speed and efficiency of completion.
- **Database Constraints:** The MySQL database is used to store employee data, including employee details and work hours, and runs in a Docker container. However, the database setup is limited to Phase 1 requirements and does not include features such as data analytics, reporting, integration with external systems, stored procedures, triggers, or scheduled tasks.
- **Time Constraints:** With an 11-week timeframe, the focus is on ensuring that the core functionality of employee information presentation, work hour, and salary calculations is achieved. Time is not allocated to expanding the system or addressing features not specified in Phase 1.
- **Testing Limitations:** Testing is concentrated on validating the functionality of employee data presentation, work hour calculation, and salary computation. System-wide testing, user acceptance testing, load testing, stress testing, performance optimization, or comprehensive security testing are not performed in this phase.
- **Optional Features:** Any features that are not explicitly stated in the Phase 1 requirements are considered optional elements. Their implementation depends on time availability after fulfilling all mandatory requirements and is at the discretion of the developer, based on available time and resources.
- **Reliance on Mentor Suggestions:** The developer welcomes mentoring and feedback from the mentor and actively seeks their comments and suggestions during mentoring sessions. However, implementation decisions are based on their impact on the project's timeline, feasibility, learning objectives, and available resources.

**Delimitations**

- **Focus on Mandatory Phase 1 Requirements:** The system will be developed strictly to meet the objectives defined in the Phase 1 requirements. Features and functionalities beyond those requirements are explicitly excluded from this phase.
- **Limited User Roles:** Phase 1 includes only basic employee details and salary calculations. Basic user roles, such as admin or system user and employee-level will be implemented though not emphasized. Based on my Phase 1 Use Case Diagram that prioritizes the Employee actor to showcase employee-facing functionalities. 
While the Admin/System user's actions aren't visually emphasized, their role is essential for system configuration, data management, and payroll initiation ‚Äì prerequisites for employee access and accurate calculations. Therefore, despite Phase 1's visual focus on the Employee, the underlying system logic is intrinsically linked to the Admin/System user.
- **Data Structure Focused on Core Information:** The MySQL database will be used solely to store employee information (employee number, name, birthday) and work hours for calculation purposes. Additional data models or relationships (such as employee benefits, payroll history, or detailed logs) are excluded from Phase 1.
- **Minimal User Interface:** Phase 1 focuses on backend functionality, and the user interface will be minimal in design. The application will operate primarily as a backend service, with employee data presented in a simple and functional format. There will be limited focus on aesthetics or advanced user interface features.
- **Limited Error Handling and Security:** While basic error handling will be implemented, comprehensive error management and security measures will not be addressed in Phase 1. The project focuses on implementing core functional calculations without implementing complex security features.
