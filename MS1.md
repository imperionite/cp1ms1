## üìå Project Scope (Phase 1)

The project scope for Phase 1 has been carefully defined to focus on the core requirements of displaying employee information and performing basic salary calculations. This concise scope allows for focused development and efficient delivery within the given timeframe. While a full payroll system requires broader functionality, these are explicitly designated for future phases.

**Included:**

*   Presentation of employee details (Employee Number, Name, Birthday).
*   Automatic salary calculation (Gross and Net) based on hours worked and predefined deductions.
*   Simple UI for viewing employee information and calculations.

**Optional:**

*   Administrator E Employee (normal user) Roles
*   Employee Management Module (Add, Edit, Delete)
*   Payroll Configuration Module (Deductions)
*   User Authentication

**Excluded:**

*   Multi-level role-based access control (RBAC beyond Admin & Employee)
*   Payroll Configuration Module (Tax Rules, Tax Rules)
*   Tax Calculations
*   Reporting
*   Full HR module integration
*   Timesheet Management
*   Fully functional web-based application beyond Phase 1 requirements

### Justification

The project scope is limited to presenting employee information and basic salary calculation due to the constraints of a single developer and a limited timeframe. More complex features, such as tax calculations and reporting, have been excluded due to their complexity and the need to maintain a manageable scope for Phase 1. The focus is on the core employee experience to ensure that the essential requirements are met effectively. 

#### **1. Data Handling Approach**
Instead of integrating with the **Google Sheets API**, the project **extracts data manually** from Google Sheets and loads it into the database through:
- **Spring Boot API Endpoint** to handle data ingestion.
- **ApplicationRunner** to initialize the database with employee and attendance data.

#### **2. Justification for This Approach**
- **Efficiency:** Avoids API complexities (authentication, rate limits, error handling) and ensures streamlined payroll computation.
- **Data Integrity:** A structured database prevents inconsistencies that may arise from collaborative editing in Google Sheets.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enables fast SQL queries for payroll calculations, rather than relying on external API requests.
- **Development Focus:** Prioritizes payroll processing logic within the **10-week timeline**, leaving room for enhancements in future phases.

This structured approach ensures the system remains **robust, maintainable, and scalable**, aligning with both project requirements and development constraints.

## üìå Use Case Diagram

### Overview
This document describes the **Use Case Diagram (UCD)** for Phase 1 of the **MotorPH Payroll System**. The system allows users to view employee details, log work hours, and calculate salaries.

#### Actor
**Employee**  
- Interacts with the system to retrieve employee details.  
- Logs work hours.  
- Triggers payroll calculations.  

##### Use Cases

###### View Employee Details
**Actor:** Employee  
**Description:** Retrieves and displays employee details such as employee number, name, and birthday.  
**Preconditions:** Employee records exist in the system.  
**Postconditions:** Employee details are displayed successfully.  

###### Log Work Hours
**Actor:** Employee 
**Description:** Users log their work hours by recording clock-in and clock-out times.  
**Preconditions:** The user is recognized by the system.  
**Postconditions:** Work hours are stored for payroll computation.  

###### Calculate Weekly Work Hours
**Actor:** Employee 
**Description:** Computes the total number of hours worked in a week based on recorded log-in and log-out times.  
**Preconditions:** Work hour records must be available.  
**Postconditions:** The system displays the calculated weekly work hours.  

###### Compute Gross Salary
**Actor:** Employee  
**Description:** Calculates the gross weekly salary based on the total hours worked and the predefined pay rate.  
**Preconditions:** Work hour records are available.  
**Postconditions:** The system displays the gross salary.  

###### Compute Net Salary
**Actor:** Employee 
**Description:** Computes the net weekly salary after applying generic deductions.  
**Preconditions:** Gross salary calculation must be completed.  
**Postconditions:** The system displays the net salary after deductions.  

##### Use Case Diagram
Refer to this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fy22zh23FYo-Yga100zrazLIi1KqGD1Y/view?usp=sharing) for the use case diagram representation of the project.

##### Justification

The UCD primarily focuses on the `Employee` actor to align with the Phase 1 requirement of demonstrating employee-facing functionality. While the Employee actor is the primary focus of the user interface and demonstrations for Phase 1, it is crucial to recognize that the Admin/System user is the logical and functional foundation of the entire payroll system. The Admin/System user possesses the privilege to configure payroll settings, manage employee data, and initiate payroll calculations for all employees. Without the Admin/System user's initial setup and ongoing management, the Employee's ability to view their information and receive accurate salary calculations would not be possible. Therefore, while the visual emphasis in Phase 1 is on the Employee interface, the underlying logic and system privileges are fundamentally dependent on the Admin/System user.
