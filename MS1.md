## üìå Project Scope (Phase 1)

The project scope for Phase 1 has been carefully defined to focus on the core requirements of displaying employee information and performing basic salary calculations. This concise scope allows for focused development and efficient delivery within the given timeframe. While a full payroll system requires broader functionality, these are explicitly designated for future phases.

**Included:**

- Presentation of employee details (Employee Number, Name, Birthday).
- Automatic salary calculation (Gross and Net) based on hours worked and predefined deductions.
- Simple UI for viewing employee information and calculations.
- JWT based authentication
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC) for admin/system user

**Excluded:**

- Multi-level role-based access control (RBAC beyond Admin & Employee)
- Payroll Configuration Module (Tax Rules, Tax Rules)
- Tax Calculations
- Reporting
- Full HR module integration
- Timesheet Management
- Fully functional web-based application beyond Phase 1 requirements

### Justification

The project scope is limited to presenting employee information and basic salary calculation due to several factors. Firstly, as an individual developer, the constraints of a limited timeframe necessitate a focused approach to ensure the core employee experience is delivered effectively.

While the recommendation to join a group was considered, the decision to proceed individually allows for a more streamlined development process and a greater degree of control over the project's direction within the given timeframe. More complex and implicit features have been excluded due to their inherent complexity and the need to maintain a manageable scope for this initial phase. The priority is to meet the essential requirements efficiently and build a solid foundation for future expansion.

#### **1. Data Handling Approach**

Instead of integrating with the **Google Sheets API**, the project **extracts data manually** from Google Sheets and loads it into the database through:

- **Spring Boot API Endpoint** to handle data ingestion.
- **ApplicationRunner** to initialize the database with employee and attendance data.

#### **2. Justification for This Approach**

- **Efficiency:** Avoids API complexities (authentication, rate limits, error handling) and ensures streamlined payroll computation.
- **Data Integrity:** A structured database prevents inconsistencies that may arise from collaborative editing in Google Sheets.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enables fast SQL queries for payroll calculations, rather than relying on external API requests.
- **Development Focus:** Prioritizes payroll processing logic within the **10-week timeline**, leaving room for enhancements in future phases.

This structured approach ensures the system remains **robust, maintainable, and scalable**, aligning with both project requirements and development constraints.

## üìå Requirement Analysis

### Overview

MotorPH is developing an end-to-end payroll system to manage employee details, work hours, and salary calculations. The project will be built in phases, expanding capabilities over time. This document outlines the requirements for **Phase 1**, which focuses on basic employee management and payroll calculations.

### Objectives

- Design and visualize the application structure.
- Develop a Spring Boot-based backend to manage employee details.
- Implement functionality to calculate work hours, gross salary, and net salary.
- Ensure data accuracy and basic security measures.

#### Functional Requirements

##### Employee Information Management

- Store and retrieve employee details in the following format:

  - Employee Number
  - Employee Name
  - Birthday

- Develop an API endpoint to fetch employee details.

##### Work Hours Calculation

- Record and process employee log-in and log-out times.
- Calculate the total number of hours worked in a week.
- Handle multiple log-in/log-out records per day.

##### Gross Salary Calculation

- Compute gross weekly salary based on the total hours worked.
- Support different hourly rates for employees.
- Define a standard overtime calculation method (if applicable).

##### Net Salary Calculation

- Apply generic deductions, specifically:
  - **Fixed Tax Rate (e.g., 10%)**
  - **Standard Benefit Contribution (e.g., PhilHealth)**
- Compute net salary after deductions.
- Ensure accurate calculations based on predefined rules.

#### Non-Functional Considerations

While not explicitly mandated in the initial Phase 1 requirements, certain non-functional aspects have been considered to ensure a solid foundation for future development and a reasonable user experience. These considerations are implemented at a basic level, focusing on efficiency and security best practices.

##### Estimated Time per Task

Refer to this [MotorPH Requirements Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WVjM2qbPiA4lTBkNgSnAEH1urHDoyUGpCUNWzILGxU/edit?usp=sharing) for the project's timeline and effort estimate in hours.

##### Estimated Project Completion

To determine the number of weeks required to complete my outputs for Phase 1 of the MotorPH Payroll System, I need to consider the estimated total hours of work and the expected weekly time commitment of 7.5 hours per week. Based on the complexity of the project, the development process involves multiple stages, including visualization, employee information display, work hours calculation, payroll computation, and system testing. If I estimate that the entire project will take approximately `75 hours to complete`, dividing this by the `7.5-hour weekly` commitment results in approximately `10 weeks to complete` the work. This timeline aligns with the expected 11-week completion timeframe.
