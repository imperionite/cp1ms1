MotorPH is a fictional company with the goal of creating a comprehensive, end-to-end payroll system to manage employee data, salary calculations, and payroll processes. The system will be developed incrementally in multiple phases, with each phase introducing new functionalities to enhance its capabilities. The first phase of the project aims to lay the foundation for the system by implementing essential features required to manage employee details and perform salary calculations based on hours worked and basic deductions.

This project will be executed individually, where the development, testing, and documentation processes will be handled by a single developer, ensuring a streamlined and focused approach to meeting the project objectives.

### **Phase 1 Objectives**

The primary focus of **Phase 1** is to implement core payroll functionalities, which include:

1. **Employee Details Presentation:** Displaying basic employee information such as employee number, name, and birthdate in a structured and easy-to-read format.
2. **Working Hours Calculation:** Automatically calculating the total number of hours an employee works during a week, enabling accurate salary processing.
3. **Gross Salary Calculation:** Computing the gross weekly salary based on the total hours worked by each employee.
4. **Net Salary Calculation:** Calculating the net weekly salary after applying standard deductions, such as taxes and insurance.

The project will be built using **Spring Boot**, a Java-based framework known for its scalability and efficiency in building enterprise-level applications. The end result will be a simple yet functional payroll system that can be expanded upon in future phases to incorporate more advanced features such as tax calculations, benefits management, and employee performance-based pay adjustments.

### **Key Features of Phase 1**

- **Presentation of Employee Information:** The system will present key employee data in a simple format, making it easy for HR personnel to access and manage.
- **Automated Salary Calculations:** The system will calculate hours worked and salary automatically, reducing human error and streamlining payroll processing.
- **Basic Deduction Logic:** It will apply basic deductions to calculate the net salary, which will be useful for the company's financial reporting and tax compliance.

### **Project Timeline and Milestones**

- **Week 1-3:** Setup of development environment and basic architecture design.
- **Week 4:** Creation of visual mockups and wireframes for the user interface.
- **Week 5:** Implementation of the employee details display feature.
- **Week 6:** Integration of the hours worked calculation functionality.
- **Week 7:** Development of the gross salary calculation feature.
- **Week 8:** Implementation of net salary calculation with deductions.
- **Week 9-10:** Comprehensive testing and debugging.
- **Week 11:** Final delivery and submission of the working system.

### **Project Scope**

**Phase 1** of the project focuses solely on establishing the core functionalities for managing employee data and payroll calculations. Future phases will enhance the system's capabilities by adding features based on the updated requirements of MotorPH in later stages.

### **Limitations and Exclusions in Phase 1**

While Phase 1 will provide essential payroll functionalities, certain advanced features will be excluded at this stage, including:

- **Complex Salary Deductions:** Advanced deductions like tax exemptions, bonus calculations, and overtime pay will not be included in Phase 1.
- **Mobile App Development:** The system will be web-based and will not support mobile platforms at this stage.
- **Advanced Security Features:** Phase 1 will implement basic security measures, including encrypted data transmission. However, more advanced features such as multi-factor authentication and granular access controls will be considered in later phases.
- **Extensive Reporting and Analytics:** Reporting features such as payroll summaries, tax reports, and other analytics are planned for future phases.

### **Conclusion**

Phase 1 of the **MotorPH Payroll System** sets the groundwork for a more comprehensive payroll management system by implementing essential features like employee details presentation, working hours tracking, and salary calculations. The system will be built with a focus on scalability and maintainability, ensuring that additional functionalities can be added as the company's needs grow. This initial phase will be developed **individually**, and will be delivered within **11 weeks**, followed by testing and refinements to ensure it meets the company's immediate payroll management requirements.
