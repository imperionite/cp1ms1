## üìå Requirement Analysis

### Overview

MotorPH is developing an end-to-end payroll system to manage employee details, work hours, and salary calculations. The project will be built in phases, expanding capabilities over time. This document outlines the requirements for **Phase 1**, which focuses on basic employee management and payroll calculations.

### Objectives

- Design and visualize the application structure.
- Develop a Spring Boot-based backend to manage employee details.
- Implement functionality to calculate work hours, gross salary, and net salary.
- Ensure data accuracy and basic security measures.

#### Functional Requirements

##### Employee Information Management

- Store and retrieve employee details in the following format:

  - Employee Number
  - Employee Name
  - Birthday

- Develop an API endpoint to fetch employee details.

##### Work Hours Calculation

- Record and process employee log-in and log-out times.
- Calculate the total number of hours worked in a week.
- Handle multiple log-in/log-out records per day.

### 9. Refactoring & Documentation

### 10. Polishing and Final Submission

##### Knowledge Needed

To accomplish these tasks effectively:

- Familiarity with database design principles.
- Understanding of payroll calculation logic.
- Knowledge of UI/UX design principles.
- Awareness of compliance regulations affecting payroll processing (optional).
- Proficiency in programming languages suitable for web applications (e.g., Java or even Python).
- Experience with security measures like encryption and access controls.

##### Additional Help Needed

Additional resources that would be beneficial include:

1.  Technical documentation and guides on database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
2.  Mentorship from experienced developers familiar with similar projects.
3.  Collaboration tools such as ClickUp.
4.  Testing frameworks like JUnit, etc. for comprehensive unit testing.
5.  User interface templates that can be customized according to MotorPH‚Äôs branding guidelines

##### Estimated Time per Task

Refer to this [link](https://tinyurl.com/mr4bjzjm) for the project's timeline and effort estimate in hours.

##### Estimated Project Completion

To determine the number of weeks required to complete my outputs for Phase 1 of the MotorPH Payroll System, I need to consider the estimated total hours of work and the expected weekly time commitment of 7.5 hours per week. Based on the complexity of the project, the development process involves multiple stages, including visualization, employee information display, work hours calculation, payroll computation, and system testing. If I estimate that the entire project will take approximately `75 hours to complete`, dividing this by the `7.5-hour weekly` commitment results in approximately `10 weeks to complete` the work. This timeline aligns with the expected 11-week completion timeframe.

## üìå Use Case Diagram

[![UCD](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oAsqdUVVkQvIatn6wIWIAOYb3HyD38I3)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAsqdUVVkQvIatn6wIWIAOYb3HyD38I3/view?usp=sharing)

This Use Case Diagram represents the **core functionalities** included within the **scope of Phase 1**. Given the limited scope of Phase 1 (employee information and salary calculation), the diagram focuses on the key user interactions related to these features.

### Description of the modules (use cases and actors) included in the diagram based on the Phase 1 requirements:

### 1. **Employee** (Primary Actor)

The **Employee** is the main user interacting with the system. Their primary goal is to view their personal information and calculate their salary based on hours worked.

#### **Use Cases:**

- **View Employee Information**:
  - The Employee views their personal details, such as **employee number**, **name**, and **birthday**. This use case allows them to access and visualize their data within the system.
- **Calculate Gross Salary**:
  - The Employee can calculate their **gross salary** based on the number of hours worked during a week. The system will compute the gross salary based on predefined rates or employee-specific rules.
- **Calculate Net Salary**:
  - After calculating the gross salary, the Employee can calculate their **net salary**, which is the amount after **deductions** (taxes, contributions, etc.) are applied.
- **Calculate Hours Worked**:
  - The Employee can input or check the number of **hours worked** in a given week. The system will compute the total working hours for that period.
- **Login**:
  - The Employee needs to log in to the system to access their details and perform the tasks above. This use case represents the **authentication** process before granting access to personal and financial data.

### 2. **Admin/System** (Secondary Actor)

The **Admin/System** actor is responsible for overseeing the system configuration, especially for security and access control purposes. This actor is responsible for tasks that impact the system but not the day-to-day employee usage.

#### **Use Cases:**

- **Configure JWT Authentication**:
  - The **Admin/System** is responsible for setting up **JWT Authentication** (JSON Web Tokens). This is a security feature that ensures **safe login** and secure sessions for Employees. Admin/System manages user sessions and authentication rules for the system.

### **General Notes**:

- **Primary Actor**: **Employee** is the main user interacting with the system and performing most of the tasks, such as viewing their information, calculating their salary, and logging in.
- **Secondary Actor**: **Admin/System** is involved in managing the security and configuration aspects of the system (like authentication setup), ensuring the system functions smoothly and securely.

### **Key Points**:

- **Employee** can perform most of the tasks related to their salary and information, with the exception of system configuration.
- **Admin/System** has administrative control, particularly in handling authentication and security measures.

## üìå Scope Delimitations and Known Limitations

To ensure a clear understanding of the boundaries of this Phase 1 implementation, this section outlines the specific functionalities that are explicitly excluded from the scope of this phase (Scope Delimitations), as well as acknowledges the known areas for future improvement in the current implementation (Known Limitations). This is intended to manage expectations and provide context for future development efforts.

**Limitations**

- **Single Developer:** As the sole developer on this project, all tasks including system design, coding, testing, and debugging are handled by one person. This may lead to limited bandwidth for tackling issues that arise during development, potentially impacting the speed and efficiency of completion.
- **Database Constraints:** The MySQL database is used to store employee data, including employee details and work hours, and runs in a Docker container. However, the database setup is limited to Phase 1 requirements and does not include features such as data analytics, reporting, integration with external systems, stored procedures, triggers, or scheduled tasks.
- **Time Constraints:** With an 11-week timeframe, the focus is on ensuring that the core functionality of employee information presentation, work hour, and salary calculations is achieved. Time is not allocated to expanding the system or addressing features not specified in Phase 1.
- **Testing Limitations:** Testing is concentrated on validating the functionality of employee data presentation, work hour calculation, and salary computation. System-wide testing, user acceptance testing, load testing, stress testing, performance optimization, or comprehensive security testing are not performed in this phase.
- **Optional Features:** Any features that are not explicitly stated in the Phase 1 requirements are considered optional elements. Their implementation depends on time availability after fulfilling all mandatory requirements and is at the discretion of the developer, based on available time and resources.
- **Reliance on Mentor Suggestions:** The developer welcomes mentoring and feedback from the mentor and actively seeks their comments and suggestions during mentoring sessions. However, implementation decisions are based on their impact on the project's timeline, feasibility, learning objectives, and available resources.
- **Data Handling Constraints:** The provided Google Sheets contains extensive data for reference; however, due to the volume of data and time constraints, it is impractical to copy every data point manually. Consequently, only a subset of essential data is seeded into the database.
- **Pre-populated Database:** The decision to seed the database via ApplicationRunner with a manually selected subset of data is deliberate. It aligns with the project requirements by using the Google Sheets solely as a reference for determining the necessary data attributes and values. This approach ensures the API is built and tested based on a realistic and representative sample of data while avoiding the overhead of integrating a live data connection.

**Delimitations**

- **Focus on Mandatory Phase 1 Requirements:** The system will be developed strictly to meet the objectives defined in the Phase 1 requirements. Features and functionalities beyond those requirements are explicitly excluded from this phase.
- **Limited User Roles:** Phase 1 includes only basic employee details and salary calculations. Basic user roles, such as admin or system user and employee-level will be implemented though not emphasized. Based on my Phase 1 Use Case Diagram that prioritizes the Employee actor to showcase employee-facing functionalities.
  While the Admin/System user's actions aren't visually emphasized, their role is essential for system configuration, data management, and payroll initiation ‚Äì prerequisites for employee access and accurate calculations. Therefore, despite Phase 1's visual focus on the Employee, the underlying system logic is intrinsically linked to the Admin/System user.
- **Data Structure Focused on Core Information:** The MySQL database will be used solely to store employee information (employee number, name, birthday) and work hours for calculation purposes. Additional data models or relationships (such as employee benefits, payroll history, or detailed logs) are excluded from Phase 1.
- **Minimal User Interface:** Phase 1 focuses on backend functionality, and the user interface will be minimal in design. The application will operate primarily as a backend service, with employee data presented in a simple and functional format. There will be limited focus on aesthetics or advanced user interface features.
- **Limited Error Handling and Security:** While basic error handling will be implemented, comprehensive error management and security measures will not be addressed in Phase 1. The project focuses on implementing core functional calculations without implementing complex security features.
